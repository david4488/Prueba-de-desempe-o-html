Instructions

The page header has two sections (logo, nav (buttons)).

The nav contains buttons that redirect to other sections.

Then comes the banner, which contains a welcome message and product photos (sweets-banner).

Then comes a text section called (paragraph).

This section seeks to engage the user.

Then comes the (paragraph-photos) section, which displays the two main products.

Then comes the (subscriptions) section, where the user fills in their subscription details.

Then comes the footer.


------------

On the secondary page (about us), you'll find the same header section but with different colors.

Then there's a section (about you), where the vision and what the brand represents are located.
And finally, there's the footer.


--------
In the third (products) section, the header doesn't change either, just the colors.

In the main section, there's the paragraph-photos section, where the product photos and prices are located.

And at the end is the footer.

------
On the third page (contact us)
there is the same header
but in the menu there is a section (contact-us)
where the user is asked to fill out some contact fields
and at the end is the footer.
